This is the forked repository from my friend's github account.
In this project, I'm in chage of all the UI / UX design and contributed to some part of the code.

 ## [üìå Report a bug](https://github.com/yuaanlin/pick-time.io/issues)

- ### Please follow the below guidelines if you would like to report a bug:

  1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
     reported.

  2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
     latest `main` or development branch in the repository.

  3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; create a [reduced test
     case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.


  Example:

  > Short and descriptive example bug report title
  >
  > A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
  > suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
  >
  > 1. This is the first step
  > 2. This is the second step
  > 3. Further steps, etc.
  >
  > `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
  >
  > Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
  > reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
  > causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
  > merits).

## [üìå Contributing to Picktime](https://github.com/yuaanlin/pick-time.io/pulls)

-  ### Follow this process if you'd like your work considered for inclusion in the picktime

   1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
      and configure the remotes:

      ```bash
      # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
      git clone https://github.com/yuuanlin/pick-time.io
      # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
      cd pick-time.io
      # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
      git remote add upstream https://github.com/yuuanlin/pick-time.io
      ```

   2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

      ```bash
      git checkout <dev-branch>
      git pull upstream <dev-branch>
      ```

   3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
      contain your feature, change, or fix:

      ```bash
      git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
      ```

   4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
      message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
      or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's
      [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)
      feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

   5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

      ```bash
      git pull [--rebase] upstream <dev-branch>
      ```

   6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

      ```bash
      git push origin <topic-branch-name>
      ```

   7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
       with a clear title and description.
